# OneHundredLeaderboard

This is a small website used as a backup leaderboard in the [OneHundredProblems](https://gasmatematica.altervista.org/onehundredproblems/info.php) friendly math contest by Mattysal.

If you care about your own sanity, please don't check the .js file. I'm not a JS developer :)
